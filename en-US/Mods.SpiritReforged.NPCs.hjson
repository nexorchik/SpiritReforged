		1: Say, you got any nice, hardy paper on you? I've done plumb run out.
		2: Gosh... dropping a pin on the ground is a bad time. Especially the brown ones.
		3: Hey, do you have a map? Mind if I take a look? Better be well kept!
		4: Finding the way once is luck. Finding the way twice takes a good map.

		Map: {
			FloatingIsland: {
				0: Let's see... it was right here! A cute little floating island I found. How'd I get there? Well, let's just say harpies can carry you WAY farther than you'd expect.
				1: Take a look here. Waaay up there! Got up to some mischief a while back, and ended up in the sky! I think there was some treasure, but I was a little too preoccupied thinking of how to get down.
				2: Check this spot out! I found an island in the sky a few weeks ago, it was cool but the neighbours were annoying! Hope you find something there that I couldn't.
			}

			EnchantedSword: {
				0: I found something... here! It was down a narrow tunnel; wouldn't you believe it, a sword in the stone, just like the legends say! I got cold feet and shied away though, I ain't worthy.
				1: Aha! Here's the spot. It looks unassuming, but there's a mighty looking sword hidden under the ground. I would have taken it, but my pockets were full of rare mushrooms and mapping paper.
				2: Here we are! Dunno how it got there, but I found a sword embedded in stone. Like that one legend...King Arthur was it? I don't mess with strange weapons though; maybe that's more your thing.

					Where was it...there it is! I was hikin' down a dark, and dangerous cave. And what do I see on the horizon? A brilliant, shimmering pink glow. Truly gorgeous.
					You know what that means in nature? Stay away. So I did.
					'''
				1:
					'''
					Um... I think it was around here. Tripped and hit my head on my way back from the ocean. When I woke up, fae little critters had taken me to this strange, and unusual place. 
					I don't remember much after that, but I did start freaking out. Those faelings took me out of there in a hurry.
					'''
				2:
					'''
					Here it is. You ever seen water? Imagine that, but it glows like the night sky. An out-of-this world purple. 
					Don't recommend drinking it, it makes your body feel fake. I don't know how to explain it. Trust me on this one.

			Savanna: {

					'''
					There we go, pin's on the house. I was up to the usual. Taking my morning walk and visiously punching trees to get apples. After punching a couple of trees, 
					I look up. Somehow, a whole prairie snuck up on me. I went back to punching trees after a few moments.
					'''
				1:
					'''
					Take a look over here. You ever just walk straight ahead, staring right at the ground? You shouldn't. But a bit ago when I did, I saw the grass slowly go from a nice vibrant green to a sickly green. 
					I look up; the largest grass I've ever seen. Thick as hell, too. So what'd I do? Well...I walked away. WAY too much work to walk in.
					'''
				2:
					'''
					So a while ago I was seeing how quickly I could run from jungle bats, right? And then boom, right over here on the map, the air gets real dusty. A savanna sprawls out in front of me. What a sight!
					And just for the record, I found out that I can run REAL quick when I need to.
					'''
			}

			Hive: {
				0: Pin goes...here. On the low, I don't recommend that jungle place. It's ROUGH. But when you see one of those big hives, there's honey nearby. And that's a treat worth many stings.
				1: There you go! Um...I'll be real. Sometimees you'll strike liquid gold and it's STILL not worth investing in. Nasty bees... keep it hike, not business.
				2: If you take a look right... here, you'll find something you may be interested in. I'll keep this short though, stingers hurt. Be prepared.

			Curiosity: {
				0:
					'''
					Here you are. Y'know, I wander a lot. Seeing the sights, thinking out loud.. well, none of that matters when the dirt kisses my face as I fall. 
					I tripped over something on the ground over here, but I couldn't tell you what it was. I was way too furious to look.
					'''
				1:
					'''
					I think it was...here? Close enough. You come across lots of interesting things when exploring as much as I do. Sometimes, you see something that's worth checking out.
					If I was you i'd make a break for it. Who knows, someone else might find it before you!
					'''
				2:
					'''
					Take a look around here. I'm a mapper, right? I map. And sometimes I lose track of all my pins... well I pinned this here map, and plumb forgot why I did it.
					Well after going all the way there, and coming all the way back, I forgot all over again. You can have it instead, maybe i'm just forgetful but I don't want no cursed doohickey.

					Check out this spot right here. It was a cold and eerie night, a hefty breeze done pulled my maps right out from my backpack.
					I dropped to the ground to retrieve my precious handiwork, when I saw it. A little pinhole sized hole in the ground, and it was glowing purple! I don't think i'm gonna go messing with that, but you seem like the brave adventurous type.
					'''
				1:
					'''
					Right here, at this point on the map! I don't know how to preface this, but you ever get those little floaties in your eye? Little lights you can't explain?
					You'd better not laugh, but I swear i've seen little pink butterflies hanging around this spot. But they ain't real! I tried to catch em' but they're made of light, I can't explain it!
					'''
				2: This here pins where it happened. I've tripped over a few holes in my day. But never in my days have I seen one glowing purple. That's some hocus pocus nonsense that I don't want any part of, keep on walking.

			WulfrumBunker: {
				0: Hopefully this is right. I was walking around as I do, and behind a copse of trees I see this weird green mechanical site. The top has all these things and from below I hear a mechanical whirring...no thanks!
				1: This was were my camp was, right there. I was taking a rest from a nice, long day of walking around, when this little machine guy with a big hand STOLE my bag. Good thing I had rested a bit, because that little guy kept me running for a while.
				2: There it is! Hard to forget it after all. You don't often find industry out here, which is good for me. I don't much care for all of the noise. Especially once an energy field appeared and scrap was flying towards me.
			}

			BloodAltar: {
				0: And... there! Charting the surface is only, well, the surface. I find a lot of strange things underground, and many of them I steer clear from... What? I'm a cartographer, not an adventurer!
				1: Should be it! You seem like the capable type. I'd found this undead fellow who actually listened to reason, which was strange enough, but he sold me this... hand. I followed where it pointed to and found myself at an unsettling crypt... Maybe you can get something out of all this, I'm not going back there.
				2: You up for a challenge? I'm not, that's for sure. There's this dungeon with a room that reeks of blood... And with that strange altar in the middle, yeah I didn't stay for long.

			2: You ever use pins? They're really useful. And old friend carried them around everywhere...last I saw she was "learning how to get on those floating islands." Tough job, huh?
			3: Sometimes I pass by a faerie, and they guide me to gold or platinum. I always act excited, but I don't have a pickaxe. I hope they appreciate it.

			2: No can do, partner. I'm not here to barter. I'm just a little overprepared, that's all. I'm a little light on snacks though...
